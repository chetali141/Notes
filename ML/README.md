# ML Notes

## Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised learning maps input x to output y, where the learning algorithm learns from the quote right answers.

Input 'x' --> Output label 'y'
Learns from being given the "right answers".

Applications: Spam filtering, speech recognition, machine translation, online advertising, self driving car, visual inspection.

The two major types of supervised learning our regression and classification.

### Regression

Predicts a number from infinitely many possible output numbers.

Example: Housing price prediction.

### Classification

Predicts class or category for given inputs.
Small number of possible outputs.

Example: Breast cancer application.

## Unsupervised Machine Learning

Given data which is not associated with any output label 'y'. Find something interesting in 'unlabeled' data.

Types: Clustering, Anomaly Detection, Dimensionality Reduction.

### Clustering

Groups similar data points together.

Application: Google news, DNA microarray, Grouping customers.

### Anomaly Detection

Finds unsual data points.

### Dimensionality Reduction

Compress data using fewer numbers.
