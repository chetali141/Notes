## Linked List

Stores collection of data items. Contiguous space is not required.
Items can't be accessed using index.

| [Cycle Detection](/Python/LinkedLists/cycleDetection.py) | . |
| [Add two numbers](/Python/LinkedLists/addTwoNumbers.py) | . |

## Stacks

LIFO - Last In, First Out.
Basic APIs:

1. Push
2. Pop
3. Top
4. Size

Wide application: Undo/Redo, Recursion, Paranthesis Balancing, Forward/Back buttons on browser etc.
In python -> easiest implementation way is using lists.

Implementation can be done using Linked List, however, you need to maintain two pointers i.e. head and tail. (Using doubly linked list.)

|File Name | Descripton |
|---|---|
| [Paranthesis Balancing](/Python/Stacks/paranthesisBalancing.py) | Check if the paranthesis are balanced are not. |
| [Reverse paranthesis](/Python/Stacks/reverseParanthesis.py) | Count the number of times you need to reverse paranthesis to balance. |
| [Minimum Stack](/Python/Stacks/minstack.py) | Find minimum element in stack. |
| [Next Greater Element](/Python/Stacks/nextGreaterElement.py) | . |

## Queues

FIFO - First In, First Out.
Basic APIs:

1. Enqueue/Push
2. Dequeue/Pop
3. Front/Top
4. Size

Wide application: printer queue, downloading queue, message buffers(Kafka, Rabbit MQ), scheduling algorithm, BFS etc.

**Deque** is a Data Structure which is mixture of stack and queue.

|File Name | Descripton |
|---|---|
| [Kth Smallest Number](/Python/Queues/kthSmallestNumber.py) | Return kth smallest number that only has digit 2,3. |

## Trees

Hierarchial data structure.

**Binary tree**: Every node of tree can have at max 2 childs.

Traversal Types:

1. Pre order: val, left, right
2. Post order: left, right, val
3. In order: left, val, right

**Note:** Always consider stack space for the space complexity of tree based questions.

|File Name | Descripton |
|---|---|
| [Tree Node](/Python/Trees/treeNode.py) | Basic inroduction to tree. |
| [Traversal in Tree](/Python/Trees/traversal.py) | . |
