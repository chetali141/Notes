Stores collection of data items. Contiguous space is not required.
Items can't be accessed using index.

## Stacks

LIFO - Last In, First Out.
Basic APIs:

1. Push
2. Pop
3. Top
4. Size

Application: Undo/Redo, Recursion, Paranthesis Balancing, Forward/Back buttons on browser etc.
In python -> easiest implementation way is using lists.

Implementation can be done using Linked List, however, you need to maintain two pointers i.e. head and tail. (Using doubly linked list.)

|File Name | Descripton |
|---|---|
| [Paranthesis Balancing](/Python/Stacks/paranthesisBalancing.py) | Check if the paranthesis are balanced are not. |

| [Next Greater Element](/Python/Stacks/nextGreaterElement.py) | . |
| [Reverse String](/Python/Stacks/reverseString.py) | Reverse a string using stack. |

## Queues

FIFO - First In, First Out.
Basic APIs:

1. Enqueue/Push
2. Dequeue/Pop
3. Front/Top
4. Size

Application: printer queue, downloading queue, message buffers(Kafka, Rabbit MQ), scheduling algorithm, BFS etc.

Python has it's own Queue module. (collection -> deque and queue -> Queue).
**Deque** is a Data Structure which is mixture of stack and queue.

### Priority Queue

It is useful when resources needs to be allocated based on some rules or precedence. The highest priority element is removed first.
Basic APIs:

1. Get - Fetch the one with the highest priority
2. Put - Add element in the queue
3. is_empty

Application: AI(A* search algorithm), optimzation algorithms, spam filtering, OS process scheduling etc.

| [Kth Smallest Number](/Python/Queues/kthSmallestNumber.py) | Return kth smallest number that only has digit 2,3. |
| [Introduction to Priority Queue](/Python/Queues/priorityQueue.py) | Introduction to priority queue. |

## Trees

Hierarchial data structure.

**Binary tree**: Every node of tree can have at max 2 childs.

**Traversal Types**: Three types of tree traversal.

1. Pre order: val, left, right
2. Post order: left, right, val
3. In order: left, val, right

**Note:** Always consider stack space for the space complexity of tree based questions.

| [Symmetric Trees](/Python/Trees/symmetric.py) | . |
| [Mirror Tree](/Python/Trees/mirrorTree.py) | . |

## Graphs

Consists of Nodes and Edges.
Types: Directed and Undirected, Weight.

Graph Traversal Algorithms: DFS and BFS.

### Depth First Search

Aggressive algorithm: It will continue down a particular path until it either finds the target or reaches a dead end.
It is a better approach when you need to find path to a given destination asap. However, it does not guarantee to provide you with the shortest path.
Implementation uses stack and dictionary.
Application: pathfinding, scheduling algorithms, assessing investment decision trees, etc.

### Breadth First Search

It's behaviour is called as **flood fill** because it behaves much like water spreading out over a surface (in unweighted graph).
Always gives shortest path if no edge weights are given.
Implementation uses queue.
Application: GPS, flight reservation systems, peer to peer networks, social media etc.

### A* Search Algorithm

Widely used algorithm for calculating shortest paths. The rule of thumb or heuristics is to chosse the next position based on the distance from the goal.
**The Manhattan Distance or Taxi Cab Distance**: used to calculate the distance between 2 points on 2D grid following the grid layout. Concept behind: Taxi needs to stay on road and can't drive through buildings.
**Eucledian Distance**: calculates distance using Pythagoras Theorm.
Application: GPS, NLP, ML, Puzzle problems, Video games, Robotics etc.

Key Values:

1. G value: best distance from start to current cell
2. H value: heuristic distance from current cell to destination
3. F value: sum of G and H value
