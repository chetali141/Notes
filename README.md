## DSA Concepts to remember

### Prefix and Suffix Sum

Prefix and suffix sums are techniques used in computer programming to calculate cumulative sums in an array.  
Prefix sum: Calculates cumulative sums from left to right in an array. The sum of elements from index 0 to i is called the prefix sum.  
Suffix sum: Calculates cumulative sums from right to left in an array.

### Carry Forward

The carry forward concept in coding is a technique that involves storing or accumulating results as you iterate through data. This allows you to reuse previously calculated values and avoid redundant calculations. It's particularly useful when dealing with problems involving sequences, subarrays, or cumulative sums.

### Sliding Window

Sliding Window problems are problems in which a fixed or variable-size window is moved through a data structure, typically an array or string, to solve problems efficiently based on continuous subsets of elements. This technique is used when we need to find subarrays or substrings according to a given set of conditions.

### Two pointer

The two-pointer technique uses two-pointers or variables to iterate through a data structure, typically an array or linked list. The key idea is that the pointers start at different positions and move in a coordinated way to traverse the data structure efficiently.
Either the pointers can move from the ends to the middle or vice versa i.e. converging or diverging pointers.
